Angular Snippets are code snippets that help you write Angular code faster and easier. They are short pieces of code that you can insert into your files by typing a keyword and pressing enter or activating them from within the editor. They are designed to follow the best practices and conventions of Angular and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you have to write. For example, you can use a snippet to create a component with a selector, a template, and a class definition in TypeScript. You can also use snippets to create directives, services, pipes, modules, routes, actions, reducers, effects, selectors and more. Snippets can also help you with common tasks such as importing modules, creating forms, subscribing to observables, using material components, etc. Snippets are available for various editors and platforms, such as Visual Studio Code, Angular Snippets website, and Angular Snippets library. You can also create your own snippets or customize the existing ones to suit your needs and preferences. Snippets are a great way to speed up your development process and to learn from the best practices of Angular.
